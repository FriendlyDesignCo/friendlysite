        <h2>Local</h2>
        <p>The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) is the largest federal employee union in the United States, representing more than a quarter million members. AFGE had a goal to improve their outdated and cumbersome extranet system. They needed to make it easier for leaders to manage their Local (or chapter) membership rolls and collect better information about their members.</p>

        <p>Our collaboration began with an in-depth discovery phase to examine what current users needed from the application. We helped the AFGE team survey its target audiences and interpret the results. The process identified core features around users’ most important actions: adding and editing member details.</p>
        
        <p>With clear goals defined, we sharpened the project strategy and began designing a compelling user experience. We created comprehensive wireframes to shape our intended interactions for the re-conceived application. Next, through design analysis we tested and refined the experience.</p>

        <p>After the framework for the site was in place, our team crafted the application’s visual design, drawing further attention to key features. We strove to make it as easy as possible for AFGE’s local leaders to find and locate the data they need to accomplish their work quickly and efficiently.</p>
        <p>Through our process with AFGE we shaped a compelling vision. We delivered html, css, and javascript for them to integrate with their system back-end. In doing so, we turned an outdated database into an engaging and user-friendly application.</p>

          We explored over a hundred name combinations before deciding on, "Game Lab," to represent the initiative’s unique position as an academic unit that also creates original work.We then put equal effort into designing a visual identity. Our result combined the GL initials into a monogram maze that was bold, eye catching, and evocative of a diverse range of games.
