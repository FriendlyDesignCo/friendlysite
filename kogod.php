            American University (AU) approached us to help shape a new initiative. They were launching a Master of Arts in Game Design degree program alongside a game production studio within the university. The degree is the only program in persuasive play in the United States. Their studio works with clients to develop games that will engage and influence specific audiences.
            <br><br>
            Our challenge was to brand and launch the new entity. We collaborated with a cross-discipline AU team; guiding them from naming the organization to creating unique brand assets, and then designing and launching a noteworthy website.

              We explored over a hundred name combinations before deciding on, "Game Lab," to represent the initiative’s unique position as an academic unit that also creates original work.We then put equal effort into designing a visual identity. Our result combined the GL initials into a monogram maze that was bold, eye catching, and evocative of a diverse range of games.

            With brand direction in place, we turned our attention to create a fun and unique. We built off the bifurcated nature of the Game Lab; its two primary components, and designed a site that felt inherently split. Visual element block slip the page horizontally, and the navigation extends to either side of the screen depending on if visitors want more information about academics, or the studio. We wanted the site to feel game-like. Panels slide as users dive deeper into content, creating an app-like experience. As we built the site we continued to expand the brand, illustrating a maze pattern and designing visual relationships between the Game Lab, AU, and AU’s website.

        <p> We worked diligently with AU’s Office of Information and Technology who built the final, fully-responsive site. We are thrilled to see it help attract new students to the program, and launch this exciting venture.
