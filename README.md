###Jeet
The friendly site uses [jeet.gs](http://www.jeet.gs) almost exclusively for layout and column structuring. Make sure that jeet isn't able to posistion something the way you want before adding something new to the codebase. Jeet's creator, [Cory Simmons](https://github.com/corysimmons) is very active on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ccccory) and is usally very helpful when it comes to solving problems in Jeet.

###Typed.JS
The Typing Animation comes from Matt Boldt's [Typed.js](..mattboldt/typed.js/). This is a relatively new plugin so check his repo sporadically to see if he's fixed any errors or added features.

###SASS
All of the CSS is written in [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) using the SCSS syntax (Sassy CSS). As tempting as it may be to just open up the CSS file and drop some changes, doing so will make the source files difficult to maintain. So whenever you need to change the stylesheet so it in SASS.
